<h1 class="heading--large">About Open States</h1>

<section>
<p>Open States strives to improve civic engagement at the state level by providing data and tools regarding state legislatures.  We aim to serve members of the public, activist groups, journalists, and researchers with better data on what is happening in their state capital, and to provide tools to reduce barriers to participation and increase engagement.
</p>

<p>
  Open States aggregates legislative information from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.  This information is then standardized, cleaned, and published to the public via OpenStates.org, a powerful <a href="https://docs.openstates.org/api-v3/">API</a>, and <a href="/data/">bulk downloads</a>.  OpenStates.org enables individuals to <a href="/find_your_legislator/">find out who represents them</a>, look up information on an important bill thatâ€™s been in the news, discover how their representatives are voting, or just stay current with what is happening in their state.  Additionally, our API and bulk downloads see millions of hits every month from advocacy organizations, journalists, researchers, and many others.
</p>

<p>
    Legislative data is collected from official sources, linked at the bottom of relevant pages.  In general bill &amp; vote data is collected multiple times a day <a href="https://github.com/openstates/openstates/">via our scrapers</a> while legislator data is <a href="https://github.com/openstates/people/">curated by our team &amp; volunteers like you</a>.

<h2 class="heading--medium">The Team</h2>

<p>
    Since November 2016 Open States has been an independently run project.  We work hard to keep Open States available free of charge and rely on user support.

</p>

<p>
    As of 2020, the core team consists of:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://jamesturk.net">James Turk</a></li>
        <li>Tim Showers</li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/hiteak">Dan Schneiderman</a> (emeritus)</li>
        <li><a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsolivia">Olivia Cheng</a> (emeritus)</li>
        <li>Miles Watkins (emeritus)</li>
        <li>Rachel Shorey (emeritus)</li>
        <li>Paul Tagliamonte (emeritus)</li>
        <li>Thom Neale (emeritus)</li>
        <li>Michael Stephens (emeritus)</li>
    </ul>

<p>But that's by no means everyone that makes the project run. A special thanks to all of our <a href="https://github.com/openstates/openstates/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and the authors and maintainers of all of the libraries that we depend upon.</p>

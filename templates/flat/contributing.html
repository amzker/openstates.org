<section>
<p>Open States strives to improve civic engagement at the state level by providing data and tools regarding state legislatures.  We aim to serve members of the public, activist groups, journalists, and researchers with better data on what is happening in their state capital, and to provide tools to reduce barriers to participation and increase engagement.
</p>

<p>
Doing all of this takes a lot of work.  Open States provides daily updates from 102 legislative chambers, and information on over 7,000 elected officials.  We do so without charging users for use of the website, our bulk data, or basic API access.
</p>

<p>That's why we rely on a lot of help from the community, whether it is helping us become aware when a piece of data is out of date, writing code to maintain our scrapers, or helping us pay the bills, every bit of help we get is vital to Open States being what it is today.</p>

<p>
  <strong>If you'd like to help, the sections below will detail various ways to help us out!</strong>
  <p>Several of the methods below mention using GitHub and some tools you may not be familiar with.  That's OK!  If you're interested in helping but lost, please reach out to <a href="mailto:contact@openstates.org">the team</a> and we'll be glad to work with you.</p>
